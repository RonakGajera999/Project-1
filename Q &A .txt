1).  Can we get from logistic regression results some indication about which features were the most important?
Ans: I) Confusion Matrix: In the confusion matrix you can show the array object. 2*2 dimention matrix which shows you to o= No and 1= yes
                          so there is 125,62 is your actual prediction and 1 and 1 are incorrect prediction shown.
     II)  precision: How accurate this model, here it shows customer 66% to 70% of the time buy a product.
     III) Recall or Sensivity: IF there are customer that bought the product in according to using any ways . 
          if they are in test data then model identify it 94% of the time.
     IV) Auc Curve: When It shows more then 50% it be good to use classifier.
     
        :: Important fact while using this is you can remove attributes that are unrealistic with your outputs 
            its work better.and its not working when you add other attributes which can not co-related with 
            your target variable.


2). What is the interpretion of graphs made using this code: df1.plot(x='NumCalls', y= 'MadeAPurchase',color='Red') ?
Ans:  The interpretion of this graph show direct affection with MadeAPurchage but its pretty ugly to predict that's
      why on downside i make box plot which shows to that yes and no on dependency of how many times do Numcalls by 
      customers and provide that its preasible to use this variable for company.
